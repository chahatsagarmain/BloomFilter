# Simple Bloom Filter in Go

A lightweight implementation of a **Bloom Filter** written in Go. This project demonstrates how probabilistic data structures work using multiple hash functions (simulated via FNV-1a) to store string existence efficiently.

## Prerequisites

* [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed on your machine.

## How to Run

1.  Save the code in a file named `main.go`.
2.  Open your terminal in the folder containing the file.
3.  Run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
